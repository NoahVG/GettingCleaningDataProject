Codebook - Mean of "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"  data by volunteer number and activity type
**Variables are explained in the order they appear in the tidy dataset, from left to right**
Labels:
-VolunteerNumber: Which volunteer (from 1 to 30) the data is for
-TypeOfActivity: What type of activity the data is gathered for (WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,STANDING,SITTING,LAYING)
-type: Is the record training data or test data?

Experiment information:
The table contains the means of all the experiment values noted below, by volunteer number and activity type.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals
 producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
 (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

For fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccMag, fBodyAccJerkMag,and fBodyBodyGyroJerkMago, the following variable was also estimated:
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

Additional vectors were obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
